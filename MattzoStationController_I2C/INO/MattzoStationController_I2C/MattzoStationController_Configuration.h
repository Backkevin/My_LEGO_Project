// This file needs to stay in the folder of the firmware for the specific MattzoController!

// Handling of different configurations:
//		It's a good idea to create copies for all the controllers of this type that you own.
//		Before compiling and uploading the firmware, just include the correct configuration into the firmware code.
//		This allows to manage specific configurations for the different controllers easily.

// Best practice:
// 1. Create a copy of this file if required (see above).
// 2. Go through the settings below and update the settings as required.

// Controller wiring specifics
// ***************************

// Infos for port expander PCA9685
// Usage:
// - If a USE_PCA9685 port expander is connected to your ESP8266, set USE_PCA9685 to true
// Wiring:
// - PCA9685 is usually connected to pins D1 (clock) and D2 (data) of the ESP8266
// - VCC is sourced from V3V of the ESP8266
// - V+ is sourced from VIN of the ESP8266 and should be between 5 and 6 Volts. According to the documentation, it will also sustain 12V, but this is not recommended (UNTESTED!)
// - Connecting GND is mandatory
// - OE should also be connected. If pulled high, servo power is switched off. Good to preserve your servos. Cabling is usually easiest if pin D0 is used as OE.
// Chaining:
// - PCA9685 supports chaining. However, this is not supported in this firmware yet. Only board 0x40 is usable at this time.
// Servos:
// - Just connect the servos as designed. Servos connected to PCA9685 must be mapped in SWITCHPORT_PIN_PCA9685.
// Signals:
// - Connecting TrixBrix signals to the PCA9685 is somewhat tricky, because of the "common anode" of the signal.
// - The solution is to connect the middle wire (plus) to V3V of the ESP8266 (NOT the plus pins of the PCA9685 ports), and the outer wires to the PCA9685 pins.
// - It is important to remember the correct way of setting a pin on the PCA9685 to:
// -- fully on: pwm.setPWM(port, 4096, 0);
// -- fully off: pwm.setPWM(port, 0, 4096);
