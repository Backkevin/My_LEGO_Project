// This file needs to be MOVED (NOT COPIED!) into the Arduino library folder
// This location of this folder depends on your system. Usually it is located in the Documents folder of the current user
// Example: C:\Users\matth\Documents\Arduino\libraries\MattzoBricks
// Attention: DELETE ALL OTHER COPIES OF THIS FILE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ARDUINO IDE IS USING THE CORRECT VERSION OF THE FILE!

// Best practice:
// 1. Navigate to Documents
// 2. Find the folder Arduino/libraries
// 3. Create a subfolder called "MattzoBricks" if it does not exist yet.
// 4. Move this file into the MattzoBricks folder that you just created.
// 5. Go through the settings below and update the settings as required.
